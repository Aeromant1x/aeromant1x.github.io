I am an undergraduate student majoring in [Mathematics](https://math.wisc.edu/), [Philosophy](https://philosophy.wisc.edu/), and [Education Studies](https://education.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sifting_and_winnowing), where my advisor is [Prof. Alexander Roberts](http://alexanderjroberts.com/).

I am primarily interested in jurisprudence, especially in specific metaphysical, epistemological, and moral questions that emerge when the law is actually applied.
