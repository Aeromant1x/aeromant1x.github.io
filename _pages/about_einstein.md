I am an undergraduate student in the L&S Honors Program majoring in [Pure Mathematics](https://math.wisc.edu/) and [Philosophy](https://philosophy.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sifting_and_winnowing), where my advisor is [Prof. Alexander Roberts](http://alexanderjroberts.com/). Before that, I graduated from [Hangzhou No.4 High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou_No._4_High_School) Cambridge A-Level Centre.

I am primarily interested in jurisprudence, especially in specific metaphysical, epistemological, and moral questions that emerge when the law is actually applied.
